# Python-Hands-On

**After trying my hands on Assembly, C/C++ & Java, i felt the need of a _very_ high-level language to automate certain things and  complete my projects with pace.**

## Purpose of this repository
1. Building projects with *Python* as wrapper for my low level code.
2. Quickly building independent web based projects in *Python 3* 
3. Help people to get started with *Python 3*

### Structure Breakdown
1. **Learnings** contains sorted python programs for paced syntax grasp with self explanatory comments.
2. **Projects** contains source code for completed projects and scripts.

**PS - Repository will be populated casually based on my comfort & interest**
